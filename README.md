GE-Flash USB EPROM Programmer Driver INF and Installers
=======================================================

This project contains the INF and installer files for configuring WinUSB for use with the GE-Flash-USB EPROM Programmer and GE-Flash EPROM programer application for Windows 7. This driver configuration file is compatible with Windows 7 and the GE-Flash-USB programmer by KG4LNE. 

These files are included with the GE-Flash application software already, but are included here for development purposes with the GE-Flash-USB programmer.

Copy the driver files to a directory on your local hard disk before connecting the USB programmer to the system. When the GE-Flash programmer is connected, windows will prompt for the location of the driver. Set the directory to point to the location of the GE-Flash-USB.INF file to install and configure the WinUSB driver for use with the GE-Flash-USB device.
